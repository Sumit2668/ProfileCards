# ProfileCards

Source files for the article on [Marcofolio.net](http://www.marcofolio.net/) called "[*Xamarin.Forms animated profile cards*](https://marcofolio.net/xamarin-forms-animated-profile-cards/)" . It uses several forms of [Xamarin.Forms Animations](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/animation/simple/) in order to display profiles in a beautiful way. Animations are called *Push*, *Slide*, *Flip* and *Explode*, and works on iOS and Android.
